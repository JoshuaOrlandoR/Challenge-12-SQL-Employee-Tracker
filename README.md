  ## Description
  This application is a command line program that helps manage a companies departments, roles, and employees. This application is meant to provide an easy way for non-developers and those unfamiliar with programming, an easy way to interact with databases. 

  ## Requirements
  This application built upon MySQL integration with node.js, and interacted with through inquirer's command line features.

  ## Installation
  To install this application, users will download this repository from Github. Users can unzip the folder where they see fit.

  ## Useage
* Once downloaded, users should open the application with any code space of their choice, such as Visual Studio Code. Open an integrated terminal in the working repository.
  
* Type npm init -y to update the package.json. Type npm i to install all required dependecies (these being inquirer, mysql2, and console.table). Once this is done, users must ensure they have MySQL login credentials on their machine, as they will need a username (which will often be root) and a password. 

* In the terminal, type mysql -u root -p. Enter your password. If you successfully log  into MySQL, please go to the server.js file and replace the * in the quotation marks with your password. 

* After this, users can exit the MySQL shell by typing exit. In the terminal, type npm start to begin prompts and navigate the databases.
